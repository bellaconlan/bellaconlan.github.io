THE CULT OF DONE MANI- <br>

    2. Accept that everything is a draft.
    It helps to get done.
    3. There is no editing stage.
    4. Pretending you know what you’re doing
    is almost the same as knowing what you
    are doing, so just accept that you know
    what you’re doing even if you don’t
    and do it.
    5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more
    than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
    6. The point of being done is not to finish but
    to get other things done.
    7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
    8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
    you from being done.
    9. People without dirty hands are wrong.
    Doing something makes you right.
    10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
    11. Destruction is a variant of done.
    12. If you have an idea and publish it on the
    internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
    13. Done is the engine of more.
