Done is the engine of more. <br>
If you have an idea and publish it on the
internet, <br>
that counts as a ghost of done. <br>
Destruction is a variant of done. <br>
Failure counts as done. So do mistakes. <br>
People without dirty hands are wrong.
Doing something makes you right.<br>
Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
you from being done. <br>
Once you’re done you can throw it away. <br>
The point of being done is not to finish but
to get other things done.<br>
Banish procrastination. If you wait more
than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.<br>
Pretending you know what you’re doing
is almost the same as knowing what you
are doing, <br> so just accept that you know
what you’re doing even if you don’t
and do it. <br>
There is no editing stage. <br>
Accept that everything is a draft.
It helps to get done.<br>
There are three states of being.
Not knowing, action and completion.<br>
