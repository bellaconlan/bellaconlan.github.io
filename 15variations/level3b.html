<em><h1>THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO</h1></em>


<div class="numbers">

<strong>1.</strong></div>
<div class="text">

There are three states of being.
    Not knowing, action and completion. </div>
<div class="numbers">
  <strong>2.</strong></div>
<div class="text">

Accept that everything is a draft.
    It helps to get done. </div>
<div class="numbers">

<strong>3.</strong></div>

<div class="text">

There is no editing stage. </div>
<div class="numbers">

<strong>4.</strong> </div>

<div class="text">

Pretending you know what you’re doing
    is almost the same as knowing what you
    are doing, so just accept that you know
    what you’re doing even if you don’t
    and do it. </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>5.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

    Banish procrastination. If you wait more
    than a week to get an idea done, abandon it. </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>6.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

  The point of being done is not to finish but
    to get other things done.
    Once you’re done you can throw it away.   </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>7.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

  Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
    you from being done.   </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>8.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

People without dirty hands are wrong.
    Doing something makes you right.     </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>9.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.     </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>10.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

  Destruction is a variant of done.   </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>11.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

If you have an idea and publish it on the
    internet, that counts as a ghost of done.     </div>
    <div class="numbers">

    <strong>12.</strong> </div>

    <div class="text">

Done is the engine of more.     </div>
